      <title>This Year We Can End the Death Penalty in California</title>
      <link>https://paulgraham.com/prop62.html</link>
      <description>If you're a California voter, there is an important proposition
on your ballot this year: Proposition 62, which bans the death
penalty.When I was younger I used to think the debate about the death
penalty was about when it's ok to take a human life.  Is it ok
to kill a killer?But that is not the issue here.The real world does not work like the version I was shown on TV growing up.  The police 
often arrest the wrong person.
Defendants' lawyers are often incompetent.  And prosecutors
are often mo...</description>

April 2001, rev. April 2003(This article is derived from a talk given at the 2001 Franz
Developer Symposium.)
In the summer of 1995, my friend Robert Morris and I
started a startup called 
Viaweb.  
Our plan was to write
software that would let end users build online stores.
What was novel about this software, at the time, was
that it ran on our server, using ordinary Web pages
as the interface.A lot of people could have been having this ...</description>

      <description>This essay developed out of conversations I've had with
several other programmers about why Java smelled suspicious.  It's not
a critique of Java!  It is a case study of hacker's radar.Over time, hackers develop a nose for good (and bad) technology.
I thought it might be interesting to try and write down what
made Java seem suspect to me.Some people who've read this think it's an interesting attempt to write about
something that hasn't been written about before.  Others say I

      <title>Being Popular</title>

      <description>(This article was written as a kind of business plan for a
new language.
So it is missing (because it takes for granted) the most important
feature of a good programming language: very powerful abstractions.)A friend of mine once told an eminent operating systems
expert that he wanted to design a really good
programming language.  The expert told him that it would be a
waste of time, that programming languages don't become popular
or unpopular based on their merits, and so no matter how
good his...</description>

for a panel discussion on programming language design
at MIT on May 10, 2001.)1. Programming Languages Are for People.Programming languages
are how people talk to computers.  The computer would be just as
happy speaking any language that was unambiguous.  The reason we
have high level languages is because people can't deal with
machine language.  The point of programming
languages is to prevent our poor frail human brains from being 
overwhelmed by a mass of detail.A...</description>

      <description>(I wrote this article to help myself understand exactly
what McCarthy discovered.  You don't need to know this stuff
to program in Lisp, but it should be helpful to 
anyone who wants to
understand the essence of Lisp Â— both in the sense of its
origins and its semantic core.  The fact that it has such a core
is one of Lisp's distinguishing features, and the reason why,
unlike other languages, Lisp has dialects.)In 1960, John 
McCarthy published a remarkable paper in

      <title>What Made Lisp Different</title>
      <link>https://paulgraham.com/diff.html</link>
      <description>(rev. May 2002)

(This article came about in response to some questions on
the LL1 mailing list.  It is now
incorporated in Revenge of the Nerds.)When McCarthy designed Lisp in the late 1950s, it was
a radical departure from existing languages,
the most important of which was Fortran.Lisp embodied nine new ideas:
1. Conditionals.  A conditional is an if-then-else
construct.  We take these for granted now.  They were 
invented
by McCarthy in the course of developing Lisp. 
(Fortran at that time o...</description>

      <description>"The quantity of meaning compressed into a small space by 
algebraic signs, is another circumstance that facilitates 
the reasonings we are accustomed to carry on by their aid."- Charles Babbage, quoted in Iverson's Turing Award Lecture



In the discussion about issues raised by Revenge

something that stuck in my mind.

Python's goal is regularity and readability, not succinctness.

"We were after the C++ programmers. We managed to drag a 
lot of them about halfway to Lisp."- Guy Steele, co-author of the Java spec




In the software business there is an ongoing
struggle between the pointy-headed academics, and another
equally formidable force, the pointy-haired bosses.  Everyone
knows who the pointy-haired boss is, right?  I think most
people in the technology world not only recognize this

August 2002(This article describes the spam-filtering techniques

Bayesian Filtering.)I think it's possible to stop spam, and that

      <description>When we were in junior high school, my friend Rich and I made a map
of the school lunch tables according to popularity. This was easy
to do, because kids only ate lunch with others of about the same
popularity. We graded them from A to E. A tables were full of
football players and cheerleaders and so on. E tables contained the
kids with mild cases of Down's Syndrome, what in the language of
the time we called "retards."We sat at a D table, as low as you could get without looking
physically diffe...</description>

that zoning laws will be relaxed to allow buildings

      <description>If Lisp is so great, why don't more people use it?  I was    
asked this question by a student in the audience at a 
talk I gave recently.  Not for the first time, either.In languages, as in so many things, there's not much     
correlation between popularity and quality.  Why does   
John Grisham (King of Torts sales rank, 44) outsell
Jane Austen (Pride and Prejudice sales rank, 6191)?
Would even Grisham claim that it's because he's a better

It's the nature of fashion to be invisible, in the
same way the movement of the earth is invisible to all
of us riding on it.What scares me is that there are moral fashions too.
They're just as arbitrary, and just as invisible to most people.
But they're much more dangerous.

      <title>The Word "Hacker"</title>
      <link>https://paulgraham.com/gba.html</link>
      <description>To the popular press, "hacker" means someone who breaks
into computers.  Among programmers it means a good programmer.
But the two meanings are connected.  To programmers,
"hacker" connotes mastery in the most literal sense: someone
who can make a computer do what he wantsâ€”whether the computer
wants to or not.To add to the confusion, the noun "hack" also has two senses.  It can
be either a compliment or an insult.  It's called a hack when
you do something in an ugly way.  But when you do somethi...</description>

(This essay was originally published in Hackers

If you wanted to get rich, how would you do it? I think your best
bet would be to start or join a startup.  That's been a 
reliable way to get rich for hundreds of years.  The word "startup" 
dates from the 1960s, but what happens in one is 
very similar to the venture-backed trading voyages of the
Middle Ages.Startups usually involve technology, so much so that the ph...</description>

      <description>When people care enough about something to do it well, those who
do it best tend to be far better than everyone else.  There's a
huge gap between Leonardo and second-rate contemporaries like
Borgognone.  You see the same gap between Raymond Chandler and the
average writer of detective novels.  A top-ranked professional chess
player could play ten thousand games against an ordinary club player
without losing once.Like chess or painting or writing novels, making money is a very
specialized skill. ...</description>

nothing of "idiotic.''I didn't mean to make the book controversial.  I was trying to make

meant that Python programmers are smart. It's a lot of

because they genuinely like to program and aren't satisfied with the languages they
already know.Wh...</description>

March 2005(This essay is derived from a talk at the Harvard Computer

good people, to make something customers actually want, and to spend
as little money as possible.  Most startups that fail do it because
they fail at one of these.  A startup that does all three will
probably succeed.And that's kind of exciting, when you think about it, because all
three are doa...</description>

the product ourselves, in a startup, and sell it to the big company.

November 2005
Venture funding works like gears.  A typical startup goes through
several rounds of funding, and at each round you want to take just
enough money to reach the speed where you can shift into the next
gear.Few startups get it quite right.  Many are underfunded.  A few are
overfunded, which is like trying to start driving in third gear.I think it would help founders to understand funding betterâ€”not

it was meaningless.  Now it seems to have acquired a meaning.  And

      <title>The Island Test</title>
      <link>https://paulgraham.com/island.html</link>
      <description>I've discovered a handy test for figuring out what you're addicted
to.  Imagine you were going to spend the weekend at a friend's house
on a little island off the coast of Maine.  There are no shops on
the island and you won't be able to leave while you're there.  Also,
you've never been to this house before, so you can't assume it will
have more than any house might.What, besides clothes and toiletries, do you make a point of packing?
That's what you're addicted to.  For example, if you find yo...</description>

      <description>When I was in high school I spent a lot of time imitating bad
writers.  What we studied in English classes was mostly fiction,
so I assumed that was the highest form of writing.  Mistake number
one.  The stories that seemed to be most admired were ones in which
people suffered in complicated ways.  Anything funny or
gripping was ipso facto suspect, unless it was old enough to be hard to
understand, like Shakespeare or Chaucer.  Mistake number two.  The
ideal medium seemed the short story, which ...</description>

August 2006, rev. April 2007, September 2010In a few days it will be Demo Day, when the startups we funded
this summer present to investors.  Y Combinator funds startups twice
a year, in January and June.  Ten weeks later we invite all the
investors we know to hear them present what they've built so far.Ten weeks is not much time.  The average startup probably doesn't
have much to show for itself after ten weeks.  But the average

October 2006(This essay is derived from a talk at MIT.)Till recently graduating seniors had two choices: get a job or go
to grad school.  I think there will increasingly be a third option:
to start your own startup.  But how common will that be?I'm sure the default will always be to get a job, but starting a
startup could well become as popular as grad school.  In the late
90s my professor friends used to complain that they couldn't get

October 2006In the Q &amp; A period after a recent talk, someone asked what made
startups fail.  After standing there gaping for a few seconds I
realized this was kind of a trick question.  It's equivalent to
asking how to make a startup succeed â€” if you avoid every cause of
failure, you succeed â€” and that's too big a question to answer on
the fly.Afterwards I realized it could be helpful to look at the problem
from this direction.  If you ha...</description>

Each person has things they like, but no one's preferences are any
better than anyone else's.  There is no such thing as good taste.Like a lot of things I grew up believing, this turns out to be
false, and I'm going to try to explain why.One problem with saying there's no such thing as good taste is that
it also means there's no such thing as good art.  If there were
good art, then people who liked it would have better taste...</description>

Founders at Work.)Apparently sprinters reach their highest speed right out of the

slow down the least.  It's that way with most startups too.  The
earliest phase is usually the most productive.  That's when they
have the really big ideas.  Imagine what Apple was like when 100%
of its employees were either Steve Jobs or Steve Wozniak.The striking thing about this phase is that it's completely diff...</description>

for 25 years: the relationship between wisdom and intelligence.
Anyone can see they're not the same by the number of people who are
smart, but not very wise.  And yet intelligence and wisdom do seem
related.  How?What is wisdom?  I'd say it's knowing what to do in a lot of
situations.  I'm not trying to make a deep point here about the
true nature of wisdom, just to figure out how we use the word.  A
wise person is someone who us...</description>

      <description>A few days ago I suddenly realized Microsoft was dead.  I was talking
to a young startup founder about how Google was different from
Yahoo.  I said that Yahoo had been warped from the start by
their fear of Microsoft.  That was why they'd positioned themselves
as a "media company" instead of a technology company.  Then I looked
at his face and realized he didn't understand.  It was as if I'd
told him how much girls liked Barry Manilow in the mid
80s.  Barry who?Microsoft?  He didn't say anything...</description>

      <description>There are two different ways people judge you.  Sometimes judging
you correctly is the end goal.  But there's a second much more
common type of judgement where it isn't.  We tend to regard all
judgements of us as the first type.  We'd probably be happier if
we realized which are and which aren't.The first type of judgement, the type where judging you is the end
goal, include court cases, grades in classes, and most competitions.
Such judgements can of course be mistaken, but because the goal is

generally look back on the mid twentieth century as a golden age.
In those days we had a large number of high-paying union manufacturing
jobs that boosted the median income.  I wouldn't quite call the
high-paying union job a myth, but I think people who dwell on it
are reading too much into it.Oddly enough, it was working with startups that made me realize
where the high-paying union job came from.  In a rapidly growing

it's money or an employee or a deal with another company, the test
for whether to do it is the same.  You should give up n% of your

poorer people are, the more stuff they seem to have.  Hardly anyone
is so poor that they can't afford a front yard full of old cars.It wasn't always this way.  Stuff used to be rare and valuable.
You can still see evidence of that if you look for it.  For example,
in my house in Cambridge, which was built in 1876, the bedrooms
don't have closets.  In those days people's stuff fit in a chest
of drawers.  Even as recently as a few de...</description>

college was more or less the meaning of life when I was growing up.
What was I?  A student.  To do that well meant to get good grades.
Why did one have to get good grades?  To get into a good college.

I had several motives, some more honorable than others.  One of the
less honorable was to shock people.  College was regarded as job
training where I grew up, so studying philosophy seemed an impressively
impractical thing to do.  Sort of like slashing holes in your clothes
or putting a safety pin through your ear, which were other forms
of impressive impracticality then just coming into fashion.But I had some more honest motiv...</description>

      <title>Cities and Ambition</title>

      <description>Great cities attract ambitious people.  You can sense it when you
walk around one.  In a hundred subtle ways, the city sends you a
message: you could do more; you should try harder.The surprising thing is how different these messages can be.  New
York tells you, above all: you should make more money.  There are
other messages too, of course.  You should be hipper.  You should
be better looking.  But the clearest message is that you should be
richer.What I like about Boston (or rather Cambridge) ...</description>

      <description>At this year's startup school, David Heinemeier Hansson gave a
 talk
in which he suggested that startup founders
should do things the old fashioned way.  Instead of hoping to get
rich by building a valuable company and then selling stock in a
"liquidity event," founders should start companies that make money
and live off the revenues.Sounds like a good plan.  Let's think about the optimal way to do
this.One disadvantage of living off the revenues of your company is that

August 2008Raising money is the second hardest part of starting a startup.
The hardest part is making something people want: most startups
that die, die because they didn't do that.  But the second biggest
cause of death is probably the difficulty of raising money.
Fundraising is brutal.One reason it's so brutal is simply the brutality of markets.  People
who've spent most of their lives in schools or big companies may

October 2008The economic situation is apparently so grim that some experts fear
we may be in for a stretch as bad as the mid seventies.When Microsoft and Apple were founded.As those examples suggest, a recession may not be such a bad time

either.  The truth is more boring: the state of the economy doesn't
matter much either way.If we've learned one thing from funding so m...</description>

big companies tend to have developed procedures to protect themselves

learning, based on disasters that have happened to it or others
like it.  After giving a contract to a supplier who goes bankrupt

VC funding will probably dry up somewhat during the present recession,

February 2009One of the things I always tell startups is a principle I learned
from Paul Buchheit: it's better to make a few people really happy
than to make a lot of people semi-happy.  I was saying recently to
a reporter that if I could only tell startups 10 things, this would
be one of them.  Then I thought: what would the other 9 be?When I made the list there turned out to be 13:

Y Combinator founders to exchange news.  It's grown bigger and taken
up more time than I expected, but I don't regret that because I've
learned so much from working on it.GrowthWhen we launched in February 2007, weekday traffic was around 1600

when they converged.  We now know the answer: computers.  It's clear
now that even by using the word "convergence" we were giving TV too
much credit.  This won't be convergence so much as replacement.
People may still watch things they call "TV shows," but they'll
watch them mostly on computers.What decided the contest for computers?  Four forces, three of which

The single biggest thing the government could do to increase the number of startups in this country is a policy that would cost nothing: establish a new class of visa for startup founders.The biggest constraint on the number of new startups that get created in the US is not tax policy or employment law or even Sarbanes-Oxley.

      <description>Om Malik is the most recent of many people
to ask why Twitter is such a big deal.The reason is that it's a new messaging 
protocol, where you don't specify the recipients.
New protocols are rare.  Or more precisely, new
protocols that take off are.
There are only a handful of commonly used ones: TCP/IP 
(the Internet), SMTP (email), HTTP (the web), and so on.  So any
new protocol is a big deal.  But Twitter is a protocol owned
by a private company.  That's even rarer.Curiously, the fact that the...</description>

I'm not sure of this, but there seems a decent chance it's true.  People are dramatically more 
productive as founders or early employees of startupsâ€”imagine how much less Larry and Sergey would have achieved if they'd gone to work for a big companyâ€”and that scale of improvement can change social customs...</description>

July 2009Now that the term "ramen profitable" has become widespread, I ought
to explain precisely what the idea entails.Ramen profitable means a startup makes just enough to pay the
founders' living expenses.  This is a different form of profitability
than startups have traditionally aimed for.  Traditional profitability
means a big bet is finally paying off, whereas the main importance
of ramen profitability is that it buys you time.

determination.  At first we thought it might be intelligence.

out of your own life, and those that you decide, from afar, are
going to be necessary to some class of users other than you.  Apple
was the first type.  Apple happened because Steve Wozniak wanted a
computer.  Unlike most people who wanted comput...</description>

      <title>How to Lose Time and Money</title>
      <link>https://paulgraham.com/selfindulgence.html</link>
      <description>When we sold our startup in 1998 I suddenly got a lot of money.  I
now had to think about something I hadn't had to think about before:
how not to lose it.   I knew it was possible to go from rich to
poor, just as it was possible to go from poor to rich.  But while
I'd spent a lot of the past several years studying the paths from
poor to rich, 
I knew practically nothing about the paths from rich
to poor.  Now, in order to avoid them, I had to learn where they
were.So I started to pay attention ...</description>

July 2010I realized recently that what one thinks about in the shower in the
morning is more important than I'd thought.  I knew it was a good
time to have ideas.  Now I'd go further: now I'd say it's hard to
do a really good job on anything you don't think about in the shower.Everyone who's worked on difficult problems is probably familiar
with the phenomenon of working hard to figure something out, failing,

      <description>What hard liquor, cigarettes, heroin, and crack have in common is
that they're all more concentrated forms of less addictive predecessors.
Most if not all the things we describe as addictive are.  And the
scary thing is, the process that created them is accelerating.We wouldn't want to stop it.  It's the same process that cures
diseases: technological progress.  Technological progress means
making things do more of what we want.  When the thing we want is

August 2010Two years ago I
wrote about what I called "a huge, unexploited
opportunity in startup funding:" the growing disconnect between
VCs, whose current business model requires them to invest large
amounts, and a large class of startups that need less than they
used to.  Increasingly, startups want a couple hundred thousand
dollars, not a couple million.

be.What went wrong?  The problems that hosed Yahoo go back a long time,
practically to the beginning of the company.  They were already
very visible when I got there in 1998.  Yahoo had two problems

September 2010The reason startups have been using

for startups to give different prices to different investors, they
help them break the sort of deadlock that happens when investors
all wait to see who else is going to invest.By far the biggest influence on investors' opinions of a startup

control of the board through a series A.  The traditional series A
board consisted of two founders, two VCs, and one independent member.

January 2012There are great startup ideas lying around unexploited right under

schlep blindness.  Schlep was originally a Yiddish word but has

task.No one likes schleps, but hackers especially dislike them.  
Most hackers who start startups wish they could do it by just writing

for a startup to work on technology, or take venture funding, or

November 2012The way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup
ideas.  It's to look for problems, preferably problems you have
yourself.The very best startup ideas tend to have three things in common:
they're something the founders themselves want, that they themselves
can build, and that few others realize are worth doing.  Microsoft,
Apple, Yahoo, Google, and Facebook all began this way.

July 2013One of the most common types of advice we give at Y Combinator is
to do things that don't scale.  A lot of would-be founders believe
that startups either take off or don't.  You build something, make
it available, and if you've made a better mousetrap, people beat a
path to your door as promised.  Or they don't, in which case the
market must not exist.

August 2013The biggest component in most investors' opinion of you is the
opinion of other investors.  Which is of course a recipe for
exponential growth.  When one investor wants to invest in you, that
makes other investors want to, which makes others want to, and so
on.Sometimes inexperienced founders mistakenly conclude that manipulating
these forces is the essence of fundraising.  They hear stories about

      <description>Want to start a startup?  Get funded by
Y Combinator.




September 2013Most startups that raise money do it more than once.  A typical
trajectory might be (1) to get started with a few tens of thousands
from something like Y Combinator or individual angels, then 
(2) raise a few hundred thousand to a few million to build the company,
and then (3) once the company is clearly succeeding, raise one or
more later rounds to accelerate growth.Reality can be messier.  Some companies raise money twice ...</description>

October 2014(This essay is derived from a guest lecture in Sam Altman's startup class at
Stanford.  It's intended for college students, but much of it is
applicable to potential founders at other ages.)One of the advantages of having kids is that when you have to give
advice, you can ask yourself "what would I tell my own kids?"  My
kids are little, but I can imagine what I'd tell them about startups
if they were in college, and that's wh...</description>

      <description>It struck me recently how few of the most successful people I know
are mean.  There are exceptions, but remarkably few.Meanness isn't rare.  In fact, one of the things the internet has
shown us is how mean people can be.  A few decades ago, only famous
people and professional writers got to publish their opinions.  Now
everyone can, and we can all see the long tail of
meanness that had previously been hidden.And yet while there are clearly a lot of mean people out there,
there are next to none a...</description>

      <title>The Fatal Pinch</title>
      <link>https://paulgraham.com/pinch.html</link>
      <description>Many startups go through a point a few months before they die where
although they have a significant amount of money in the bank, they're
also losing a lot each month, and revenue growth is either nonexistent
or mediocre.  The company has, say, 6 months of runway.  Or to put
it more brutally, 6 months before they're out of business.  They
expect to avoid that by raising more from investors.
[1]That last sentence is the fatal one.There may be nothing founders are so prone to delude themselves

      <description>I recently got an email from a founder that helped me understand
something important: why it's safe for startup founders to be nice
people.I grew up with a cartoon idea of a very successful businessman (in
the cartoon it was always a man): a rapacious, cigar-smoking,
table-thumping guy in his fifties who wins by exercising power, and
isn't too fussy about how.  As I've written before, one of
the things that has surprised me most about startups is 
how few of

Assuming their expenses remain constant and their revenue growth
is what it has been over the last several months, do they make it to
profitability on the money they have left?  Or to put it more
dramatically, by default do they live or die?The startling thing is how often the founders themselves don't know.

      <description>One advantage of being old is that you can see change happen in
your lifetime.  A lot of the change I've seen is fragmentation.  US
politics is much more polarized than it used to be.  Culturally we
have ever less common ground. The creative class flocks to a handful
of happy cities, abandoning the rest.  And increasing economic
inequality means the spread between rich and poor is growing too.
I'd like to propose a hypothesis: that all these trends are instances
of the same phenomenon.  And more...</description>

And because anything a famous scientist did that

seem risky either.Biographies of Newton, for example, understandably focus
more on physics than alchemy or theology.
The impression we get is that his unerring judgment

Accidental moderates end up in the middle, on average, because they
make up their own minds about each question, and the far right and
far left are roughly equally wrong.You can distinguish intentional from accidental moderates by the
distribution of their opinions. If the far left opinion on some

      <description>When I was young, I thought old people had everything figured out.
Now that I'm old, I know this isn't true.I constantly feel like a noob. It seems like I'm always talking to
some startup working in a new field I know nothing about, or reading
a book about a topic I don't understand well enough, or visiting some new
country where I don't know how things work.It's not pleasant to feel like a noob. And the word "noob" is
certainly not a compliment. And yet today I realized something

      <title>How to Write Usefully</title>
      <link>https://paulgraham.com/useful.html</link>
      <description>What should an essay be? Many people would say persuasive. That's
what a lot of us were taught essays should be. But I think we can
aim for something more ambitious: that an essay should be useful.To start with, that means it should be correct. But it's not enough
merely to be correct. It's easy to make a statement correct by
making it vague. That's a common flaw in academic writing, for
example. If you know nothing at all about an issue, you can't go
wrong by saying that the issue is a complex ...</description>

daring. How could they feel safe saying such things?The answer, I realized, is that they didn't think they could get
caught. They didn't realize there was any danger in making false

itself a guarantee of success. You could be earnest but incapable.

it's ok to kill murderers. It's about whether it's ok to kill
innocent people, because at least 4% of people on death row are
innocent.When I was a kid I imagined that it...</description>

because it would be hard to build a replacement for reading, but
because even if one existed, it would be insufficient. Reading about

or missing, or broken? You can see anomalies in everyday life (much
of standup comedy is based on this), but the best place to look for
them is at the frontiers of knowledge.Knowledge grows fractally.

      <title>How to Do Great Work</title>

      <description>If you collected lists of techniques for doing great work in a lot
of different fields, what would the intersection look like? I decided
to find out by making it.Partly my goal was to create a guide that could be used by someone
working in any field. But I was also curious about the shape of the
intersection. And one thing this exercise shows is that it does
have a definite shape; it's not just a point labelled "work hard."The following recipe assumes you're very ambitious.

      <title>Superlinear Returns</title>
      <link>https://paulgraham.com/superlinear.html</link>
      <description>One of the most important things I didn't understand about the world
when I was a child is the degree to which the returns for performance
are superlinear.Teachers and coaches implicitly told us the returns were linear.
"You get out," I heard a thousand times, "what you put in." They
meant well, but this is rarely true. If your product is only half
as good as your competitor's, you don't get half as many customers.
You get no customers, and you go out of business.It's obviously true that the ret...</description>

      <title>The Best Essay</title>
      <link>https://paulgraham.com/best.html</link>
      <description>Despite its title this isn't meant to be the best essay. My goal
here is to figure out what the best essay would be like.It would be well-written, but you can write well about any topic.
What made it special would be what it was about.Obviously some topics would be better than others. It probably
wouldn't be about this year's lipstick colors. But it wouldn't be
vaporous talk about elevated themes either. A good essay has to be
surprising. It has to tell people something they don't already know.T...</description>

      <title>How to Start Google</title>

      <description>(This is a talk I gave to 14 and 15 year olds about what to do now
if they might want to start a startup later. Lots of schools think
they should tell students something about startups. This is what I
think they should tell them.)Most of you probably think that when you're released into the
so-called real world you'll eventually have to get some kind of
job. That's not true, and today I'm going to talk about a trick you
can use to avoid ever having to get a job.The trick is to start your own com...</description>

      <title>The Reddits</title>

      <description>I met the Reddits before we even started Y Combinator. In fact they
were one of the reasons we started it.YC grew out of a talk I gave to the Harvard Computer Society (the
undergrad computer club) about how to start a startup. Everyone
else in the audience was probably local, but Steve and Alexis came
up on the train from the University of Virginia, where they were
seniors. Since they'd come so far I agreed to meet them for coffee.
They told me about the startup idea we'd later fund them to drop...</description>

      <title>The Right Kind of Stubborn</title>
      <link>https://paulgraham.com/persistence.html</link>
      <description>Successful people tend to be persistent. New ideas often don't work
at first, but they're not deterred. They keep trying and eventually
find something that does.Mere obstinacy, on the other hand, is a recipe for failure. Obstinate
people are so annoying. They won't listen. They beat their heads
against a wall and get nowhere.But is there any real difference between these two cases? Are
persistent and obstinate people actually behaving differently? Or
are they doing the same thing, and we just la...</description>

      <description>At a YC event last week Brian Chesky gave a talk that everyone who
was there will remember. Most founders I talked to afterward said
it was the best they'd ever heard. Ron Conway, for the first time
in his life, forgot to take notes. I'm not going to try to reproduce
it here. Instead I want to talk about a question it raised.The theme of Brian's talk was that the conventional wisdom about
how to run larger companies is mistaken. As Airbnb grew, well-meaning
people advised him that he had to run ...</description>

      <title>When To Do What You Love</title>
      <link>https://paulgraham.com/when.html</link>
      <description>There's some debate about whether it's a good idea to "follow your
passion." In fact the question is impossible to answer with a simple
yes or no. Sometimes you should and sometimes you shouldn't, but
the border between should and shouldn't is very complicated. The
only way to give a general answer is to trace it.When people talk about this question, there's always an implicit
"instead of." All other things being equal, why wouldn't you work
on what interests you the most? So even raising the qu...</description>

      <description>I'm usually reluctant to make predictions about technology, but I
feel fairly confident about this one: in a couple decades there
won't be many people who can write.One of the strangest things you learn if you're a writer is how
many people have trouble writing. Doctors know how many people have
a mole they're worried about; people who are good at setting up
computers know how many people aren't; writers know how many people
need help writing.The reason so many people have trouble writing is tha...</description>

      <title>The Origins of Wokeness</title>
      <link>https://paulgraham.com/woke.html</link>
      <description>The word "prig" isn't very common now, but if you look up
the definition, it will sound familiar. Google's isn't bad:

  A self-righteously moralistic person who behaves as if
  superior to others.

This sense of the word originated in the 18th century, and
its age is an important clue: it shows that although
wokeness is a comparatively recent phenomenon, it's an
instance of a much older one.There's a certain kind of person who's attracted to a
shallow, exacting kind of moral purity, and who dem...</description>

      <title>What to Do</title>

      <description>What should one do? That may seem a strange question, but it's not
meaningless or unanswerable. It's the sort of question kids ask
before they learn not to ask big questions. I only came across it
myself in the process of investigating something else. But once I
did, I thought I should at least try to answer it.So what should one do? One should help people, and take care of
the world. Those two are obvious. But is there anything else? When
I ask that, the answer that pops up is Make good new thi...</description>

      <title>Good Writing</title>
      <link>https://paulgraham.com/goodwriting.html</link>
      <description>There are two senses in which writing can be good: it can
sound good, and the ideas can be right. It can have nice,
flowing sentences, and it can draw correct conclusions
about important things. It might seem as if these two
kinds of good would be unrelated, like the speed of a car
and the color it's painted. And yet I don't think they
are. I think writing that sounds good is more likely to
be right.So here we have the most exciting kind of idea: one that
seems both preposterous and true. Let's ...</description>

      <title>The Shape of the Essay Field</title>
      <link>https://paulgraham.com/field.html</link>
      <description>An essay has to tell people something they don't already know. But
there are three different reasons people might not know something,
and they yield three very different kinds of essays.One reason people won't know something is if it's not important to
know. That doesn't mean it will make a bad essay. For example, you
might write a good essay about a particular model of car. Readers
would learn something from it. It would add to their picture of the
world. For a handful of readers it might even ...</description>

      <title>How to Lose Time and Money</title>
      <link>https://paulgraham.com/selfindulgence.html</link>
      <description>When we sold our startup in 1998 I suddenly got a lot of money.  I
now had to think about something I hadn't had to think about before:
how not to lose it.   I knew it was possible to go from rich to
poor, just as it was possible to go from poor to rich.  But while
I'd spent a lot of the past several years studying the paths from
poor to rich, 
I knew practically nothing about the paths from rich
to poor.  Now, in order to avoid them, I had to learn where they
were.So I started to pay attention ...</description>

      <title>Having Kids</title>

      <description>Before I had kids, I was afraid of having kids. Up to that point I
felt about kids the way the young Augustine felt about living
virtuously. I'd have been sad to think I'd never have children.
But did I want them now? No.If I had kids, I'd become a parent, and parents, as I'd known since
I was a kid, were uncool. They were dull and responsible and had
no fun.  And while it's not surprising that kids would believe that,
to be honest I hadn't seen much as an adult to change my mind.
Whenever I'd n...</description>
